            "1. Lie on the bench with your eyes under the bar\n2. Grab the bar with a medium grip-width (thumbs around the bar!)\n3. Unrack the bar by straightening your arms\n4. Lower the bar to your mid-chest\n5. Press the bar back up until your arms are straight",
            "Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width",
            "Lie with your head and shoulders supported by the bench and your feet flat on the floor. Hold the dumbbells directly above your chest, palms facing each other, then lower the weights in an arc out to the sides as far as is comfortable. Use your pectoral muscles to reverse the movement back to the start.",
            "1. Connect a standard handle to a tower, and move the cable to the highest pulley position.\n2. With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable.\n3. With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, reach upward with your other hand and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended.\n4. In one motion, pull the handle down and across your body to your front knee while rotating your torso.\n5. Keep your back and arms straight and core tight while you pivot your back foot and bend your knees to get a full range of motion.\n6. Maintain your stance and straight arms. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner.\n7. Repeat to failure.\n8. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.",
            "1. To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.\n2. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.\n3. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.\n4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nVariations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\n\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\n\nMore advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.",
            "1. To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.\n2. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.\n3. Keeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n4. Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
            "1. Grab the pullup bar with your palms down (shoulder-width grip)\n2. Hang to the pullup-bar with straight arms and your legs off the floor\n3. Pull yourself up by pulling your elbows down to the floor\n4. Go all the way up until your chin passes the be bar\n5. Lower yourself until your arms are straight\n",
            "1. Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n2. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.\n3. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.\n4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
            "1. Start by hanging from the bar, hands at approximately shoulder-width apart, palms pointing away from you, and elbows fully locked.\n2. Initiate the pull by exhaling forcefully – tightening your core – and retracting your shoulders down and back with your lat muscles and also flexing your elbows with your biceps.\n3. Continue to pull until your arms are fully flexed – elbows in tight to your sides – and pause briefly before beginning to lower yourself\n(note: your chin will likely be at or slightly above the bar’s level).\n4. Slowly lower yourself to the bottom, deadhang position – inhaling as you go – until your arms are fully locked. Pause briefly and then repeat for reps.",
            "1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm's length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.\n2. Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.\n3. Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.",
            "1. Sit back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand held at arms length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.\n2. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second.\n3. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in.\n4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
            "1. Stand with the bar on your upper-back, and your feet shoulder-width apart\n2. Squat down by pushing your knees to the side while moving hips back\n3. Break parallel by Squatting down until your hips are lower than your knees\n4. Squat back up while keeping your knees out and chest up\n5. Stand with your hips and knees locked at the top\n\nHold the weight for a second at the top. Breathe. Then take a big breath, hold it and Squat your next rep\n",
            "1. Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight.\n2. With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement.\n3. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.",
            "1. Stand with the bar on your front shoulders, and your hands next to your shoulders\n2. Press the bar over your head, until it’s balanced over your shoulders and mid-foot\n3. Lock your elbows at the top, and shrug your shoulders to the ceiling.",
            "1. Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.\n2. Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side.\n3. Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.\n4. As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top.\n5. After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale.\n6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
